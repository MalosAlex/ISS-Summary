# University Project Summary

This repository summarizes the work done during our university project. We started one project, then switched to another, and finally merged them in two phases. Below is a breakdown of each stage with links to their respective repositories.

## 🔹 Project 1: First Project
**Description**: This was our starting point, focusing on making the diagrams for our part of the project, then implementing it. I was the lead for my team, we managed to make quite a decent beginning for the project, which was then picked by another team. The project was implemented in C# using the layered architecture MVVM.

## 🔹 Project 2: Taking on a different project
**Description**: We got the repository of another team, part of a another project completely. Here, as still the lead, my team made mock tests for each functionality from the previous project, removing business logic from views and making the code clean, ditching lambda functions and bad names for variables and functions.

## 🔹 Merge Attempt 1
**Description**: We merged out quarter of project with another quarter of the same project. Here I took on the role of tech lead, reviewing each pull request, and enforcing working with pull requests by making me and the other lead as code owners and requiring at least one approval. Besdies reviewing code, I helped my collegues with whatever questions they had, I made a pdf of coding conventions for the team to follow and also went into the code as well, being the person who actually merged the 2 projects, due to lack of manpower at the time. After merging, we had to use ServiceProxies with ASP.NET and make the app from a desktop one with WinUI, to a network one using mvvc.

**Description**: Here, the 4 quarters(2 halves now) merge into a singular project. Here I took on the role of web technical lead, this is still a work in progress.

## 📝 Notes
- All work was done in separate repositories.
- This repo only serves as a summary and navigation point.
- This was not only my work, the first team was of 7 people including me, the first half was of 13 and the final team was with around 25 people. I do not take credit for what I did not do, as lead my main work was overseeing the code and coding as well when time allowed me or when we were in a time crisis.
